    <a href="https://ninjoz.github.io/course-management-tool/"><h2>DFS</h2></a>
    <p>DFS is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that systematically explores
        vertices and edges, effectively traversing through the depths of the graph. Its
        recursive nature allows for straightforward implementation, making it a popular
        choice for various tasks such as cycle detection, topological sorting, and finding
        connected components.</p>
    <a href="bfs.html"><h2>BFS</h2></a>
    <p>In contrast to DFS, BFS traverses a graph level by level, exploring
        neighbors of a vertex before moving to its neighbors' neighbors. This
        characteristic lends itself well to finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs,
        determining connectivity, and solving puzzles like finding the shortest path in a
        maze.</p>

        <a href="kruskal.html"><h2>Kruskal</h2></a>
        <p>Kruskal's algorithm addresses the problem of finding a minimum spanning
            tree in a weighted graph. By iteratively selecting edges in ascending order of
            weight while avoiding cycles, Kruskal's algorithm constructs a minimum spanning
            tree efficiently, making it a cornerstone in network design, clustering, and
            optimization problems.</p>
    <a href="prim.html"><h2>Prim</h2></a>
    <p>Similar to Kruskal's algorithm, Prim's algorithm also tackles the minimum
        spanning tree problem. However, it takes a different approach by growing the tree
        from an arbitrary starting vertex, iteratively adding the shortest edge that connects
        the growing tree to an unvisited vertex. This greedy strategy ensures the
        construction of a minimum spanning tree and finds applications in network design,
        routing, and clustering.</p>
