## Description

This project is an application that simulates several graph algorithms. It provides a practical and visual understanding of how Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Kruskal's algorithm, and Prim's algorithm work.

## Features

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., all the vertices at the current level are visited before moving on to the next level.

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: DFS is another graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in depth-first order i.e., it explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: This algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree of a connected and undirected graph. It treats each node as an isolated tree and connects one pair of trees at a time.

- **Prim's Algorithm**: Prim's algorithm also finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph but it starts from a random vertex and greedily grows the tree from there.
